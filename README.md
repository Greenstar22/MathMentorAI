# MathMentorAI
All the files I used to create my math app, MathMentor AI. This includes the data files, the python scripts, and the original data.
Feel free to use anything useful you find here.
NOTE: Make sure to correctly cite the original dataset that supports the research described in the paper A Benchmark for Math Misconceptions: Bridging Gaps in Middle School Algebra with AI-Supported Instruction by Nancy Otero, Stefania Druga, and Andrew Lan.
